# XZZ PCB (Encrypted Boardview) File Format Specification

> Reverse-engineered with reference to the [OpenBoardView](https://github.com/OpenBoardView/OpenBoardView) source.

---

## Overview

XZZ is an encrypted binary boardview format. The file contains DES-encrypted data blocks
for parts, pins, nets, and board outline geometry. The header may be XOR-obfuscated.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Extension | `.pcb` |
| Detection | First 6 bytes = `XZZPCB` (plain or XOR-obfuscated) |
| Encryption | DES (FIPS PUB 46-3), ECB mode |
| DES key | `0xdcfc12ac00000000` (fixed, hardcoded) |
| Coordinate unit | Internal units ÷ 10000 = mils |
| XOR obfuscation key | Byte at offset `0x10` |

### `.pcb` extension collision — Mentor PADS Layout binary

The `.pcb` extension is also used by **Mentor PADS Layout (PowerPCB) native binary
design files**, which are an entirely different and unsupported format (the PADS
database, not a boardview). They begin with the 10-byte signature `00 FF 26 20`
followed by six zero bytes and carry PADS markers in the body (`DOC_PARTTYPES`,
`DOC_PADS`, `DOC_VIAS`, `STANDARDVIA`). `isPadsBinaryHeader()` recognises them so
both `XZZFormat.detect()` and `parseXZZ()` reject them up-front with a clear
"this is a PADS Layout binary, not a boardview" message — otherwise the `.pcb`
extension fallback would hand them to the XZZ parser, which XOR-mangles the bytes
(PADS files have a non-zero byte at `0x10`) and dies on "invalid header offsets".
Even FlexBV does not open these; the binary PADS database is left unsupported.

## File Structure

### Header

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 6 bytes: "XZZPCB" magic │  (may be XOR-obfuscated)
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Header fields            │  file metadata, block offsets
│  (variable layout)       │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

#### XOR Obfuscation

If the first 6 bytes don't spell `XZZPCB` in plain text, the header is XOR-obfuscated:
- XOR key = byte at offset `0x10`
- Apply `byte ^ key` to each header byte to recover plain text
- Verify by checking if decoded bytes 0–5 = `XZZPCB`

### Data Blocks

After the header, the file contains sequential data blocks. Each block is DES-encrypted
and must be decrypted before parsing.

Block types:
- **Net block** — net index → net name mapping
- **Part blocks** — component data with embedded pin sub-blocks
- **Outline segments** — board outline geometry (line segments on layer 28)
- **Arc blocks (`0x01`)** — centre/radius/start/end arcs, on the outline, the
  silkscreen or a copper layer (see *Arc sweep direction* below)

---

## Encryption

### DES Parameters

- Algorithm: DES (Data Encryption Standard, FIPS PUB 46-3)
- Mode: ECB (each 8-byte block encrypted independently)
- Key: `0xdcfc12ac00000000` (64-bit, fixed)
- Decryption: standard 16-round Feistel network with reversed subkey order

### Block Decryption

Each data block is decrypted as a sequence of 8-byte DES blocks. Trailing bytes (< 8) are
left as-is.

---

## Data Structures

### Net Block

Sequential entries, each containing:

```
┌──────────────┐
│ u32: netSize  │  Total entry size in bytes
├──────────────┤
│ u32: netIndex │  Net identifier (referenced by pins)
├──────────────┤
│ name bytes    │  Null-terminated string (netSize - 8 bytes)
└──────────────┘
```

### Arc blocks (`0x01`) — sweep direction

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ u32: layer       │  28 = outline, 17 = silkscreen, 1–16 = copper/mask
│ i32: cx, cy      │  Centre, ÷ 10000 → mils
│ i32: radius      │
│ i32: angleStart  │  Degrees ÷ 10000 — 1130129 = 113.0129°
│ i32: angleEnd    │
│ u32: width       │  Present on 32-byte (multi-layer) blocks
│ u32: netIndex    │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**An arc is the counterclockwise sweep from `angleStart` to `angleEnd`, and the
sweep is normalised into `[0, 360)` — never into `(−180, +180]`.**

The stored quadruple names *two* arcs — the CCW one and the CW one — so the
normalisation is not hygiene, it is the choice of which arc gets drawn. Two
rules must both hold, and losing either one is enough to draw the wrong half:

- **Lift negatives.** `angleEnd < angleStart` is an ordinary wrap, not a
  reversed arc: `sweep = end − start; if (sweep < 0) sweep += 360`.
- **Never reduce.** Nothing may pull the result back under 180°, and the
  endpoints may not be swapped or the sweep `abs()`-ed. A swap discards exactly
  the information that distinguishes the two candidate arcs.

Both arcs share the same two endpoints, so the endpoints cannot detect the
error — the **midpoint** is the discriminator, and the symptom is an arc that
bulges the wrong way while terminating in the right places.

`Mini4 Pro-PP003675.04 MB PCB layer` pins this. Its layer-28 arcs are four
major arcs at the two ends of the outline plus two ordinary corner fillets;
raw angles are ÷ 10000, and `xzz-arc-sweep.test.ts` asserts the midpoints.

| id | centre (x, y) | r | start | end | sweep |
|----|---------------|---|-------|-----|-------|
| A | 532474990, 531872990 | 307610 | 1130129 | 3472309 | 234.218° |
| B | 518264289, 531735380 | 331240 | 1615879 |  516079 | 250.020° |
| C | 515725710, 531735380 | 331240 | 1283920 |  184120 | 250.020° |
| D | 501515009, 531872990 | 307610 | 1927690 |  669870 | 234.218° |
| E | 508875000, 533275000 | 235000 |       0 |  900000 |  90° |
| F | 500995000, 501069060 | 519060 | 2250000 | 2700000 |  45° |

A/D and B/C are mirror pairs about x = 516994999.5, and the exporter mirrors
each angle **and** swaps start/end (`mirror(A.end) = D.start`). That swap is
only meaningful if the stored order encodes a direction, which is the file's
own evidence that these are directed CCW arcs rather than undirected chords.

E and F are the diagnostic: a shortest-arc clamp gets both of them right and
only breaks A–D, whereas a reflection applied without swapping the endpoints
turns them into 270° and 315°. Which one is wrong tells you where to look.

Until 2026-08-16 the parser swapped the endpoints when `start > end`, then
added 360 to `start` whenever the remaining span still exceeded 180° — a
shortest-arc normalisation wearing the clothes of angle wrapping. It has no
negative-lift at all, so the swap broke B, C and D while the clamp separately
broke A, and every arc over 180° rendered as its complement.

### Outline integrity — the butterfly fold must not eat the loop

The board outline is a set of **closed** loops: the perimeter plus one loop per
cutout. Downstream this is not decorative — the renderer fills each sub-path,
so an open loop is filled by joining its two loose ends with a straight line,
and a broken outline shows up as black wedges laid across the board rather
than as a missing line somewhere.

Two facts make this fragile, and both were learned the hard way:

1. **Arc-sampled corners produce very short segments.** Every outline arc is
   linearised into 9 pieces, so a 90° fillet of r = 14.6 mil steps 0.8 mil at
   a time. Any tolerance-based reasoning about outline segments has to stay
   well under that, or it cannot tell a segment from its own neighbour.
2. **The butterfly fold rewrites the segment list.** It discards the half it
   is not keeping; anything else it removes comes straight out of the visible
   outline.

The bug that taught this (fixed 2026-08-07): the fold's duplicate-edge guard
compared endpoints with a fixed **1-mil** epsilon. Both endpoints of a 0.8-mil
segment lie within 1 mil of both endpoints of the segment it is joined to, so
every arc-sampled fillet was deleted as a "duplicate" of its own neighbour.
The loop was cut open at each rounded corner: on A2485-820-02100-A the outline
went from one closed 767-point loop to **18 open fragments** with end gaps up
to 5,934 mil on a 4,924-mil-wide board. Eight of the 32 corpus files were
affected — the "PCB layer" and YiDianTong AP/BB exports, which are the ones
with fine-sampled arcs.

Two invariants worth keeping:

- **A duplicate is a coincident edge, not a nearby one.** XZZ coordinates are
  integers ÷ 10000 and identical arcs sample to identical floats, so real
  duplicates are exactly equal; `dedupeCoincidentSegments` keys on endpoints
  quantised to 0.01 mil, which is two orders of magnitude below the shortest
  real segment. Duplicate and neighbour are then distinguishable by
  construction rather than by a tuned threshold.
- **Check the pre-fold geometry before blaming the file.** `BoardData.rawOutline`
  holds the un-folded outline. Every corpus file chains into closed loops
  there, so a broken final outline means the fold did it.

For reference, OpenBoardView's `XZZPCBFile.cpp` neither deduplicates, chains,
nor folds — it draws the layer-28 segments as a flat list. Chaining, filling
and the butterfly fold are BoardRipper's own, so their correctness is ours to
own; there is no upstream behaviour to defer to here.

Residual known gap: `SM-G930F S7 YiDianTong` carries a genuine 1.03-mil
discontinuity in its own outline, 3% beyond the chain walker's 1-mil vertex
tolerance. It renders as closed (the fill spans 1 mil invisibly) and the
tolerance is deliberately **not** widened to absorb it — a tuned threshold is
what caused the bug above.

### Part Block

After DES decryption:

```
┌──────────────────┐
│ u32: partSize     │
├──────────────────┤
│ 18 bytes: unknown │
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: groupNameLen │
│ groupName bytes   │
├──────────────────┤
│ 0x06 marker byte  │
│ 30 bytes: unknown │
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: nameLen      │
│ partName bytes    │  Reference designator
├──────────────────┤
│ Sub-blocks...     │  0x05 silk line, 0x06 label, 0x09 pin, …
└──────────────────┘
```

### Label Sub-Block (`0x06`) — component value

A part body may carry `0x06` sub-blocks: silkscreen **text** elements placed
on the part. Same framing as the part header's own `0x06`, minus 4 bytes —
a body sub-block spends those on its own size prefix:

```
┌──────────────────┐
│ 0x06 marker byte  │
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: size         │  Payload length
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: layer        │  Always 17 (silkscreen) in the surveyed corpus
│ 22 bytes: unknown │  Placement — x/y, height, flags
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: textLen      │  0 when the element carries no string
│ text bytes        │
└──────────────────┘
```

**What the text holds is exporter-specific**, and this is the whole
difficulty of the field:

- MSI (and other Cadence/PADS re-exports) write the **BOM value** — `22uF`
  under `C757`, `1nF` under `C905`. That is the useful case: the parser
  lifts it into `Part.meta.value`, which the Info pane, net branch list and
  MCP part search all already render.
- Apple's exporter writes a **serialised placeholder** — `Device1`,
  `Device2`, … one per part, never repeated. Seven boards in the local
  corpus do this, up to 4,955 labels on a single board.
- Most boards (iPhone, Samsung, iPad, MECHREVO) write `textLen = 0`.

The parser therefore takes the first body label that isn't the refdes, then
applies a **board-level placeholder guard** before committing any of them: a
value column that is ≥95% distinct across ≥20 parts *and* ≥80% alphabetic-
then-numeric (`Device1`, `Part207`) is exporter scaffolding, not a BOM — a
board full of passives repeats `100nF` and `10K` constantly — so the whole
channel is dropped and no part gets a value. Real values lead with the
magnitude (`22uF`, `10K`, `0R`) and so never match the serial pattern.
Logged under `(pcb values)` either way.

### Pin Sub-Block

Within a part block, pins are encoded as typed sub-blocks:

```
┌──────────────────┐
│ u32: pinBlockSize │
├──────────────────┤
│ 4 bytes: unknown  │
├──────────────────┤
│ i32: x            │  Pin X position (÷ 10000 for mils)
│ i32: y            │  Pin Y position (÷ 10000 for mils)
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: drill        │  Through-hole drill diameter (÷ 10000 for mils);
│                   │  0 on an SMD pin. See below.
│ u32: padAngle     │  Pad rotation in degrees CCW (÷ 10000)
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: nameLen      │
│ name bytes        │  Pin name
├──────────────────┤
│ 27 bytes: pad geom│  3 × (u32 padW, u32 padH, u8 shape) — three identical
│                   │  copies (top/inner/bottom?); w/h ÷ 10000 for mils;
│                   │  shape 0x01 = round, 0x02 = rect
├──────────────────┤
│ 5 bytes: padding  │
├──────────────────┤
│ u32: netIndex     │  Reference into net block
└──────────────────┘
```

**Drill diameter.** This field was documented as a constant zero for a long
time, because the boards surveyed first are SMD-only. It is a drill: non-zero
means the pin is through-hole, and the value is the hole diameter on the usual
÷10000 = mils scale. Evidence, gathered independently on two disjoint corpora
(Sean Johnson, [@sjohnson1021](https://github.com/sjohnson1021), issue #32 —
Switch / PS5 / MSI; and 32 local `.pcb` files, 415,520 pins):

- **The annular-ring relation never breaks.** The value is always strictly
  smaller than both pad dimensions — 253 non-zero readings here, zero
  inversions. A flag field has no reason to respect a physical constraint.
- **It is sparse and it lands where through-holes live.** 0.03–0.43% of pins
  per file, on connector legs, headers and mounting pins; never on a top-level
  `0x09` test pad, which is right — probe points are surface features.
- **One drill spans two pad shapes on the same part.** `N2494` on
  A2442-820-02098-A carries drill 10.5 on both its 20×26 oblong pads and its
  round ones — what you would expect of a bit diameter, not of anything
  derived from pad geometry.
- Only the "PCB layer" export family populates it; the "boardview" variants of
  the very same Apple boards leave it zero.

Parsed into `Pin.drill` / `Pad.drill`, and any part with a drilled pin is
typed `throughhole` instead of the blanket `smd` every XZZ part used to claim.

**Slots.** The hole in an oblong pad is the *same capsule at a smaller
radius*, not a circle centred in it: a stadium is every point within `r` of a
line segment, so the pad is that segment inflated by `min(w,h)/2` and the slot
is the same segment inflated by `drill/2`. The copper ring is then uniform all
the way round, caps included, with no margin to tune. The renderer gets this
for free by drawing the pad shape at a negative `grow` of `−(min(w,h) − drill)/2`,
since `grow` is a true geometric offset and cancels out of the centre→cap
distance. Square pads degenerate to exactly `circle(drill/2)`; non-round shapes
keep a plain circle, because a shrunken rectangle is not a drill.

**Pad-geometry record list.** The 27 bytes after the pin name are documented
above as three fixed chunks. They are really a terminated record list —
`(w, h, type)` records until a `type` byte of `0x00`, then a 5-byte terminator
— and "read the first, skip 32" is only correct because every pin carries
exactly 3 records. That holds for all 415,520 pins here and across the issue
#32 corpus (Sean Johnson, @sjohnson1021), so there is nothing to fix against;
a file with 1, 2 or 4+ records
would silently misalign the `netIndex` read rather than fail loudly.

**Oblong pads (shape 0x01 with w ≠ h).** Shape `0x01` is not strictly a
circle: with w ≠ h it encodes a round-capped stroke (stadium). The pen width
is whichever dimension is **shorter** and the stroke length whichever is
longer — there is no fixed axis, either field can be the pen — rotated by
`padAngle` CCW. The surveyed
MECHREVO corpus (PL5TU1B) writes a constant 15-mil pen with lengths 1–350
mil. Renderer draws these as rotated capsules (`capsuleParams` in
`renderer/pad-capsule.ts`). Three caveats, handled by
`normalizeOblongPads` in the parser (run before the butterfly fold):

1. **Bogus lengths on BGA perimeter rings.** CPU1's outer 2–3 ball rings
   carry 15×300/350 entries that would cross a dozen neighbouring balls;
   the vendor's own assembly drawing shows plain 15-mil dots there
   (probably escape-stub metadata, not pad copper).
2. **One angle per part.** The exporter stamps a single `padAngle` on every
   pin of a part, but a QFP's top/bottom leads are physically perpendicular
   to its left/right leads (EC1: all 128 pins say 270°).
3. **Degenerate strokes** (h ≤ w, e.g. 15×1) — effectively dots drawn with
   the 15-mil pen.

The guard is physical — copper pads of different pins can never overlap:
an oblong is kept at its declared angle if it touches no same-part
neighbour's pen circle, else retried at +90° (fixes the QFP sides), else
collapsed to a pen-width round dot. A majority pass then collapses
gap-threading stragglers of a mostly-bogus (w, h) group (CPU1 pin W1).

**Placeholder pad geometry.** Some exports — all surveyed M2-era Apple board
files (820-02773, 820-02862, and the `-H`/`-L` CPU variants of 820-02098 /
820-02100 / 820-02382) — write the SAME pad geometry on every pin of the file:
12×12 mil, shape `round`, angle 0. This is exporter filler, not real pad data
(a 125-mil coil pad and a BGA ball get the identical 12-mil dot). Real-geometry
files carry 180+ distinct sizes, so the two populations are cleanly separable.
The parser detects the placeholder (≥100 geometry-carrying pins, every one
sharing a single identical `(w, h, shape, angle)`, shape round, w = h) and
drops pad geometry entirely for that file — pins fall back to the classic
radius-8 dot and the renderer synthesizes the classic FlexBV 2-pin pads.

## Board Outline

The outline is constructed from line segments on layer 28 (`OUTLINE_LAYER`).
Segments are chained into a polygon using a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm:
1. Start with segment 0
2. For each subsequent segment, find the nearest unvisited endpoint
3. Append the far endpoint to the chain

---

## Coordinate System

- Raw coordinates are signed 32-bit integers
- Divide by 10000 (`XZZ_SCALE`) to get mils
- The `flipY` flag is enabled for this format

---

## Parser Notes

- Side detection: part side is inferred from sub-block type bytes within the part data.
- Pin radius defaults to 7 mils.
- The DES implementation uses precomputed SP (S-box + P permutation) lookup tables and
  byte-level IP/FP permutation tables for performance.
- BigInt is used only for one-time key schedule computation at module initialization.

---

## Diode-Value Channel (post-`v6` table)

XZZ ships companion `.pcb` files named `… Middle layer diode value-<board>.pcb`
that carry reference ("golden board") **diode-mode multimeter readings**. The
readings are **not** geometry — they live in a plaintext table appended after
the `v6v6555v6v6` XOR-boundary marker (so they are never XOR'd or DES'd), past
the net block.

```
v6v6555v6v6===<4 binary bytes>\n
=359=N47(21)
=0=N47(31)
=OL=N46(1)
=732=N47(7)
…
```

- Grammar: newline-delimited `=<value>=<partName>(<pinNumber>)`, **one record
  per pin**.
- Value classes: integer **millivolts** (e.g. `359`), `OL` (open / infinite),
  `0` (no reading / tied to ground). A rare malformed token like `312.` is
  tolerated (trailing dot stripped).
- Join key `PART(pinNumber)` maps 1:1 onto the parser's pins — this is why the
  parser now preserves the real pad number (`Pin.number`) instead of a 1-based
  index.

`parseDiodeSection()` returns `Map<"PART(PIN)", DiodeReading>`; the join stamps
`Pin.diode` and sets `BoardData.diodeReference` (counts + match diagnostics).
Normal boardviews have no marker → empty map → no channel. The readings are
surfaced on-pin (toggleable overlay), in the hover tooltip, and in the
ComponentInfo pin table; OpenBoardData provides a second, per-net source feeding
the same surfaces (see `store/diode-readings.ts`).
